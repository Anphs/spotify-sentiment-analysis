# Spotify Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) classifier to determine trends by analyzing a user's Spotify playlist. By leveraging APIs such as Spotify and LyricsGenius, the classifier retrieves song titles, artists, and lyrics to perform sentiment analysis and classify moods of the songs. The goal is to categorize the mood of each song in a playlist and provide insights into the overall mood trends in the playlist.

## Features

- Spotify Integration: Uses the Spotify API to fetch song titles and artists from a user's selected playlist.

- Lyrics Retrieval: Retrieves song lyrics from the LyricsGenius API for the selected songs.

- Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for sentiment analysis to classify the mood of each song into categories like happy, sad, energetic, calm, or romantic.
